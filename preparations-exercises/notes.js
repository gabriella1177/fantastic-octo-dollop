/* 
Question 5:
Identify the Constructors for each of the 
following methods and classify each method 
as either a "Static" or a "Prototype" method:

substring - String, prototype
create - Object, static
fromCharCode - String, static
slice - Array, String, prototype
toString - Array, Object, Number, String, prototype

It might be that more than one constructor
 provides a method with a given name. 
 Make sure you list them all in your answer. 
 You can limit your search for methods to the 
String, Object, Array, and Number constructors.
